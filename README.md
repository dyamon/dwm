# A personal fork of dwm - the suckless dynamic window manager

## Patches

Look at the commit history for more details on how these patches were
applied.

### Statusbar

+ [notitle](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/notitle/) - remove window
  name area from statusbar;
+ [statusallmons](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statusallmons/) -
  render statusbar on all monitors;
+ [hidevacanttags](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/hide_vacant_tags/) -
  display only tags with at least one client;
+ [statuspadding](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuspadding/) - add
  configurable horizontal/vertical padding to statusbar;
+ [status2d](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/status2d/) - allow
  changing fg/bg color and rectangle drawing in statusbar.
+ [statuscmd](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscmd/) - integrates
  with [dwmblocks](https://git.dyamon.me/dwmblocks) to provide clickable
  areas in the statusbar through signals.

### Layouts

+ [bottomstack](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/bottomstack/) -
  mirrored version of the `tile` layout (only `bstack` has been
  patched and renamed to `btile`);
+ [centeredmaster](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/centeredmaster/) -
  layout where the master area is positioned on a central column with
  the stack area split on both sides (only the `centeredmaster` layout
  has been patched and renamed to `centmaster`);
+ [gaplessgrid](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/gaplessgrid/) -
  positions clients in a grid;
+ [deck](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/deck/) - monocle for the stack
  area. The master area is maintained as for the `tile` layout while the
  stack area behaves like a deck of cards;
+ [actualfullscreen](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/actualfullscreen/) -
  add true, pre-client, toggleable fullscreen;
+ [sticky](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/sticky/) - add per-client,
  toggleable stickiness across tags;
+ [ru_gaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/ru_gaps/) - add gaps
  between clients, modifiable at runtime. Additional patches had to be
  applied for each additional patched layout;
+ [cyclelayouts](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/cyclelayouts/) - add
  the ability to cycle through layouts instead of binding each of them
  to a specific key.

### Misc

+ [restartsig](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/restartsig/) - add
  signal handling to cleanly kill/restart dwm.

Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
